A couple of my projects here, listed from easiest to hardest :)
* Tictactoe -interaction in console
* Battleship -interaction in console 
* Checkers -interaction in console
* Ufo_Encounter -interaction in console, to play this game you have to set path to checker and tictactoe game in play file.
The next are three games like above but you can lose really easly in this games hence minmax algorithm was implemented.
* Tictactoe_Ai -interaction in console, 
* Battleship_Ai -interaction in console
* Checkers_Ai -interaction in console
Now two games that took me a little more time to create. These game are based on pygame library. 
To run these games you have to have installed pygame package on your machine.
* Tictactoe_Pygame -graphical interaction
* Checkers_Pygame -graphical interaction
